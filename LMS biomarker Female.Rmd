## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
require(gamlss)
library(gamlss)

CXM <- read.csv("CXM normal data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

female <- subset(CXM, Sex == 'F', select=c("Sex", "Age", "CXM"))
               
youngfemale <- subset(female, Age < 21, select=c("Sex", "Age", "CXM"))
```




```{r}
m1<- lms(CXM, Age, families = "BCTo", data=youngfemale,method.pb="ML",cent = c(3,10,25,50,75,90,97), calibration=TRUE, trans.x=TRUE )
```



```{r}
z<-z.scores(m1, youngfemale$CXM, youngfemale$Age)
plot(youngfemale$Age, z,ylim=range(-4,4), xlim=range(0,21), col="red")
```
